# restaurant

Programmed by Flutter 

A program for booking restaurants that allows two types of the user (admin & customer).

The admin can upload products, which are food, drink and sweets, and also can edit and delete them, and also he can follow up on all reservations through the reservation system and he can refuse the reservation by deleting it as long as the day has not passed since the customer booked the appointment

The user can follow the products, book an appointment in the restaurant, choose food, drink and sweets
He can also follow up on his reservations and amend them as long as the day has not passed since his reservation

The system can detect appointments previously registered in the system and not allow registration on the same date for another client because the system was originally designed for parties, birthdays and large events (it can be modified)
